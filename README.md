# VSTLSIM
A ***very simple*** traffic light simulator coded in ***C***. 

# DISCLAMER:
- This **is NOT** a ***full*** traffic light simulator.
  - This is just a recreation of a design of a traffic light.
- This is a **re-upload**.
  - I made this **originally** about **2 years** ago (**2022**).


# FAQ:
- Will you **update** this anymore?
  - **Not** ***unless*** someone has an **issue** with it.
- Does this work on **MacOS** or **Linux**?
  - **No** as it relies ***heavily*** on the **Windows API**.
- If you work on this again, will you add **MacOS** or **Linux** support?
  - ***Probably*** **not** as I am pretty **busy** with **other projects**.
